# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
   We started by thinking of the basis of the project and then drafted the main classes. Then, we focused more on game logic and how the user would be bale to interact with the game. Finally, we coded the game, adding additional features and tweaking as we went.
   
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
   I had to gain a better understanding of the use of hashtables and arrays and randomizing different variables.
    
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
   I wish we could have gone for a more graphical user interface rather than an episode-style game.
   
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
   I would love to implement a more complicated menu as well as questions that are based on the menu. I also think adding a timer for each phase of the game would make it more interesting.
   
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
   I think my group provided the most helpful feedback. we were able to help each other out with different aspects of the code and kept each other from overcomplicating things too much.
   
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
   I would develop a better strategy to be able to test each portion of the game more efficiently and comprehensively.
   
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
   I enjoyed working with my team - everyone efficiently handled their tasks, and I didn't feel overwhelmed when we faced challenges or roadblocks during the initial planning phase because we were all able to share and discuss ideas with each other.
