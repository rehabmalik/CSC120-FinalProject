This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command. (Explained in the Game class)

    - *welcome* guests when they arrive
    - *greet* your table once they've all sat down and take their order
    - *enter* their order so it gets sent to the kitchen
    - *serve* their food

    - If customers have any questions, be sure to answer them by picking the correct answer that you will be given beforehand
    - Don't be afraid to ask for help, but make sure you answer customers quickly. We wouldn't want to keep anyone waiting!
    - Hint: Type 'help' if you're not sure what to do next

    - There is no diagram of the floor layout but there is a main room where the tables are and a kitchen separately


# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

    - If you don't mess up 3 times and use all of your "fuckups" you will get fired and you will lose. If you don't use all of them, you will be tipped a decent amount and you will win! 
    - you can ask the kitchen for help with the questions if you are not sure, but it will not give you an opportunity to answer if you ask for help
